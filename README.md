# Ethereum-Sandwich-Bot---Easy-UX
Ethereum-Sandwich-Bot is simple boot, Maximal Extractable Value bot is an arbitrage tool 
that sniffs the Mempool for pending transactions on decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap and PancakeSwap. 
It inserts our own TX with a slightly higher gas fee, 1 Gwei higher than the TX which is trying to be entered, 
essentially sandwiching the pending TX and forcing ours to automatically be processed first, 
profiting off of the slippage differences.
